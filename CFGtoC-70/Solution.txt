Analyzing the flow graphs tells us the following at a glance:

1 is a one process loop
2 is a conditional
3 is a conditional in a multi-process loop
4 is a 1 step process

Judging from these, we can see that using these formats, the only matches can be:

1 - B
	int loop(int a)
        {
            while (a >= 0) { // Here is the loop
                a--; // Here is the single process
            }
            return a;
        }
2 - C
	int control(int a, int b)
        {    
            if (a > b) // Here is the conditional
                return b;
            else 
                return a;  
            
        }
3 - D
	int for_loop(int a, int b, int c)
        {
            int i;

            for(i = 0; i < b; i++) // For loops are a loop with a condition and single operation/process
                 a = c + i; // Second process, creating multiprocess loop
            return a;
        }
4 - A
	int modulo(int a, int b)
        {
            return b % a; // Here is the single process / operation
        }
